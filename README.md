Hello World!
This project was made as the first group project in the 2021 September session of Wild Code School's Lille's branch.
It was made by Pierre Goemans, Jonathan Guillot, CÃ©dric Lassalle, Bertrand Briset and Guillaume Keerhem.

The goal of the project was to create a webpage to introduce everyone from the 2021 September's session so we can learn to know each other.

The project is mainly based on JavaScript, the Wilders cards being generated via DOM manipulation. We also used only vanilla JavaScript.
The informations to load for each person is load in a array and is generated by a class.
We also add more visual interraction by making the cards flip to reveal some buttons, which lead to social medias or to the modal that show the
informations about the person.
The modal's content is also load in JavaScript, with a function that will delete everything in it when we push the close button, so we can use only
one modal to load all informations needed.
With that, the website, in one way, emulate a server request system only using vanilla JS.
We also implemented a search bar so we can search more efficiently the Wilders we want informations about.
